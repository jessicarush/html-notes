# HTML notes

A collection of brief HTML reference notes and checklists.

For the most accurate information see the [W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/index.html#contents). It's a little intense looking at first but if you do a quick find `âŒ˜f` of the element you're looking for in the sidebar table of contents, you'll get to the information pretty quick. Everything you need to know is there.

The [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) tend to be easier to follow. Another friendly, trustworthy source is [W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/).

Remember, there's a lot of misinformation out there regarding HTML elements intent and proper usage. In addition, the recommendations do evolve over time. If in doubt, check with the W3C.
