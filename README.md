# HTML notes

A collection of brief HTML reference notes and checklists.

For the most accurate information see the [W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/index.html#contents). It's a little intense looking at first but if you do a quick find `âŒ˜F` of the element you're looking for in the sidebar table of contents, you'll get to the information pretty quick. Everything you need to know is there.

Another, friendlier but trustworthy source is [W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/).
The [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) are also awesome.

Remember, there's a lot of misinformation about there regarding HTML elements intent and proper usage. In addition, the recommendations do evolve over time. If in doubt, check with the W3C.
